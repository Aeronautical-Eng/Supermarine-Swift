Cockpit Animations:
	- rudder pedals
	- throttle
	- flaps lever
	- gear lever
	- stick
	- (some) switches?
	- panel texture needs editing to remove GPS 
	- instruments are uneven in lighting - look at applying glass effect to all glass surfaces
	- instruments from hunter could do with texture

Pilot:
	- grab Alphasim one from Valiant, with textures from swift (they're the same model)

Gear:
	- main gear is uneven, needs either repositioning or reconverting from MDL (have converted model in full extension position)
	- add compression animation
	- add wheel rotation animation

Lights:
	- lightpack
	- cockpit lighting

Effects:
	- afterburner from trunk F-8E (single effect works on all pipelines)
	- wing condensation
	- wing tip condensation
	- engine smoke
	- contrail
	- guns

Sounds:
	- make sure startup sound only runs when engine is starting (check yasim engine management script)
	- wheel contact sound
	- afterburner
	- intake/exhaust roar (see firebee)
	
Bombable:
	- guns
	- nasal model data

FDM:
	- look at enabling afterburner via nasal so that full military thrust is available
